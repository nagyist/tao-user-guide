# Creating a new item

>Questions and other forms of *interaction* are considered *item* components of larger *tests*. These basic elements are first created, and then combined for use in assessing test-taker performance in acquiring understanding.

There are more than 17 types of interactions that TAO will allow test-authors to create. Each interaction item, and the procedure used to create it, differs to some degree from the other, but there are certain steps that are held in common for authoring any interaction. These steps will be detailed here. 

**Step 1:** Click the *Items* icon.

This will bring you to the Items page, likely showing the last interaction in which you, or the user before you, edited. However, in this tour, you are creating a new Item.


**Step 2:** In the *Library*, click the *class* or folder that the interaction (and associated test) applies. 

This will bring up a new Actions Bar that includes the following options: Properties, New Class, New Item, Export, and Import.


**Step 3:** Click on *New Item* in the Actions Bar.

This will bring up a new dialog box that gives you the option to name, or *label* your item, and radio buttons that give you the choice between selecting the model type for this item as either QTI or Open Web Item. QTI format allows for easier and greater flexibility of use in various TAO products.


**Step 4:** After naming and selecting model type, save.

This produces an empty item that you can now populate with questions. Close the dialog box reminder that the item has been saved before moving on.


**Step 5:** In the Actions Subheader menu, find the option that reads *Authoring* and click it.

This will produce the empty Items page upon which youâ€™ll place your interaction. Your focus should next rest on the left panel, which shows as a default the *Common Interaction* catalogue. Below this are the *Inline Interactions* and *Graphic Interactions* and *Custom Interactions* catalogues, which are hidden behind a grey bar.
