# Graphic Order Interaction

>The Graphic Order item gives test-takers the opportunity to demonstrate knowledge about chronological order, orders of importance, etc. as seen on a graphic (map, photo, other image).

>All graphic items can be found in the Graphic Interactions menu (the third bar down) in the Library Panel. All require dragging the appropriate icon, such as the Graphic Order item icon, over the blank Item and dropping it on the blue block field that appears when the icon is passed over it. This will result in the results manager window coming up, through which the test-author will select a main question graphic. A list of previously uploaded graphics will appear, above which is a blue button for selecting new graphics to upload. Once this graphic is selected or uploaded, work may begin on the specific item.

>For the Graphic Order item, a new interaction-authoring window will appear with the graphic in the center of the canvas. Above the graphic will be a field for writing in the question associated with this Item. To the left will be an Associable Hotspot Panel for inserting selected shapes that will represent Associable Hotspots into the graphic (these include four different shapes: rectangle, circle, oval, and polygon). Below the Hotspot Panel will be a trash can icon, which allows the user to delete a poorly-placed or misshaped Hotspots. Below the graphic is a gap match field for entering in answers (in the form of graphic elements).

**Step 1:** Fill in the question field. 

This should cover such important information as what the graphic represents, and what the test-taker is supposed to do in this Item.

**Step 2:** Insert the *Associable Hotspots* onto the graphic.

To place a rectangle, click on one corner and drag across the intended area the Hotspot is supposed to cover. To place a circle or oval, select its center and drag outward or inward until the Hotspot is at the right size. To place a polygon, begin at one corner, then click on each corner in succession until the Hotspot is completed. All the shapes can be edited, but if necessary, click on the problem Hotspot, then click the trash can to delete it, and then try again. 

After the Hotspots are added in, the minimum and maximum number of choices that a test-taker can provide will need to be entered in the field located at the bottom of the Properties Panel. A minimum above zero requires that the test-taker provide an answer to the question before moving off the item, while the maximum should be above zero in order that the test-taker can provide at least one answer to the question.

**Step 3:** Click Response in the header bar to set the hot spots in the order required by the question.

This will bring up the same screen, but it is now possible to associate the numeric order with the hot spots selected.

**Step 4:** Associate the order numbers with the appropriate Hotspot.

To do this, click on the number, then the Hotspot. Repeat until all the numbers are assigned a Hotspot.

**Step 5:** Click the blue *Done* button.

When this is done, you can preview what your Graphic Order item looks like. For more on previewing, review its section.
