# Choice Interaction #

>Choice Interaction, most frequently referred to as the multiple choice question (MCQ), presents a test question type that has been made popular by such time-honored exams as the SAT, ACT, PSAT/NMSQT, etc. 

<!--I would suggest another rubric: like "In which case use it" that clearly explain to the user in which case this interaction would be convenient"--> 


**Step 1:** From the Common Interactions menu in the Left Frame, drag the *Choice* icon (the upper left option) onto the blank Item and drop the resulting box in the blue field that appears when you drag the *Choice* element over it.

This provides the selection boxes for your multiple choice question. 
<!-- What do you mean by "selection boxes?" --> 


**Step 2:** By default, the cursor should be on the question field above three answer *choices*.  <!-- I think it would be clearer to not "mix" the steps. So in step 2 only, I would rather place everything that concerns the text --> 
Enter the question in the question field at the top of the *Interaction box*. <!-- this is not in the item level -->

Note that the A icon on the right <!-- not left :-) --> allows you to put your text in bold or in italic for instance, and insert a picture to you question.  

**Step 3:** This interaction has by default three choices in which to place alternative answers. Click *choice #1* text to edit the field it is in. Type the first answer option in this field. Repeat this step with the other choices to populate those fields.

However, you can add more options by clicking the *Add Choice* blue field below the first three choices (keep clicking until the desired number of choices appear in the item), and you can delete options by clicking the trash can icon to the right of the choice you wish to delete. 

<!-- ""You'll note that the same style icon exists within the Properties Panel on the far right."" I not fully understand what you mean by this? -->

The A icon on the right allows you to put your text in bold or in italic for instance, and insert a picture to you question.  


**Step 4:** When all your choices have been defined, go on the far right, and open the Interaction Properties pull down frame. Then define the number of choices <!-- ""Items is confusing --> that the user will be asked to provide.

By default, your MCQ is made of checkboxes, with a max of 0 (that means that your test-taker can select as many as choices he wants) and a min of 0 (that means that your test-taker is not required to answer). 

To set up a radio button quiz item, select a maximum of 1. This means that your test-taker will be not allowed to select more than one choice.
You can see on your item canvas that radio buttons will be displayed.

Tips -> If you question is required, the Min choice should be at least "1" . If you question is not required, select "0". 

Additionally, you'll notice above this in the Interaction Properties pull down frame is the option to *shuffle choices*.  Check this option will make your choices appear in a different order for each test-taker. This allows the test publisher to negate the use of tried test-taker strategies of guessing like "always select B if you don't know" or for cheating between earlier test-takers and those taking the test after them. Where the order isn't important, this is recommended. 

Tips -> Realize that to use this option, you won't want to prefix answers with A., B. … or 1., 2. … etc.


**Step 5.** Now to define the scoring options, on the Interaction Header  <!-- rater than Item header--> , click on *Response* on the far right, next to the trash can (avoid clicking the trash can, as this will lead to deleting the item) <!-- I'm afraid that if we speak about the trash can, this will put the user's focus on that point and lead to unwanted deletion ....-->

This activates options for indicating the correct answer for use in scoring.


**Step 6.** Select the correct answer by clicking the box ahead of it.

You can select more than one answer.  <!-- not always, if the question is made of radio button.-->


 <!-- This explanation is for more advanced users:
 
 **Step 7.** Click anywhere outside the Work Space. This will produce in the Properties Panel (to the right) a check box that can be set if the interaction is to be time dependent (completed within a certain interval) by the test-taker. Check if this is the case.

Time dependence is useful for limiting the time in which a test-taker has to get through interactions within the examination. This will be covered in greater detail in Deliveries. -->


**Step 7.** Click *Done* once you have finish your Choice Interaction.


You'll want to review your work at this point. You can edit the text already there by clicking on it. Again, click *Done* once you have finished editing.


**Step 8.** To see what the test-taker will see click *Preview* in the Item Action Bar .
