# Order Interaction

>The Order item gives test-takers the opportunity to demonstrate knowledge of a particular order of elements. These can include chronological orders, priority orders, alphabetical or numerical orders, orders of size, etc.

**Step 1:** From the Common Interactions menu in the Library Panel, drag the *Order* icon onto the blank Item and drop the resulting box in the blue field that appears when the item is dragged over it.

This creates a new Order Interaction window. There will be a field for placing in a question at the top, and two side-by-side panels, the left of which provides fields for the options to be placed in an appropriate order.

**Step 2:** Fill in the question field. 

This will describe the task given to the test-taker ("Place the following in chronological order", etc.).

**Step 3:** Fill in the options to be placed in order.

These may be in a particular other order from what is being sought by the question, or mixed up.

**Step 4:** Fill in the answers after clicking Response in the blue item header.

To do this, click the options in the correct order requested by the question field.

**Step 5:** Click the blue *Done* button.

When this is done, you can preview what your Order item looks like. For more on how to preview, review its section.
