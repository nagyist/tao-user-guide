# Extended Text Interaction

>The Extended Text item provides the means of demonstrating the text-taker's ability to recite exactly a phrase, sentence, or passage. The test-taker is required to convey exactly an answer that can be of any length. 

**Step 1:** From the Common Interactions menu in the Library Panel, drag the *Extended Text* icon onto the blank Item and drop the resulting box in the blue field that appears when you drag the *Extended Text* element over it.

This opens a new Extended Text Interaction window. By default, the window will begin on Question mode (rather than Response mode) and will show a question field and an 'extended text field'. 

**Step 2:** Fill in the question field. 

Bear in mind that the answer should be one that the test-taker will be expected to remember exactly, without any variation whatsoever. Even an extra space will result in the answer being marked incorrect.

**Step 3:** Click response in the Item header.

Here, the test-author will provide the expected answer. Again, the test-taker will be expected to answer exactly. Any variation from what is entered here will result in the answer being marked as incorrect.

Because of the exacting nature of this Item, it is frequently the case that the test-author will want to enter a *Modal Feedback* (such as "Nailed it!" if the test-taker got the answer right, or "Not quite" if the answer was wrong). The procedure can be found in its own section.
