# Text Entry Interaction

>Text Entry allows the test-taker to complete a "fill the blank" question with an exact text answer. This interaction is one of two *Block*-related interactions, the other being *Inline Choice* (covered in its own section). In order to begin creating either an *Inline Choice* or *Text Entry* item, it is first necessary to select the Inline Interactions bar, and then drag the *Block* Item, represented by a letter *A* icon, out of the left-hand Library Panel and into the canvas area, dropping it into the blue text block that will appear. This will create a field in which text may be cut and pasted from a favorite source (a Word document or website, for instance), or typed in. 

**Step 1:** Once the text is placed, create a Text Entry field by dragging from the Library Panel to a space next to where the test-taker will be expected to *fill the blank*.

This creates a pop-up window showing the blank to be adjusted. In the default Question mode, no changes can be made to the blank, as the test-taker is expected to enter in the answer. However, a correct answer will need to be selected and this is done in the Response mode.

**Step 2:** Click Response in the pop-up header.

This opens the response entry window, in which you can enter in the correct answer. Note that the test author will need to produce an answer that the test-taker will be expected to exactly match, character-for-character, including spaces. The maximum size of an answer that can be entered into a single field is X characters.

**Step 3:** Remove the text that the Text Entry blank is supposed to replace.

This necessary step effectively completes the replacement of text by the Text Entry blank. 

**Step 4:** Click anywhere outside of the Work Space. This will produce in the Properties Panel a check box that can be set if the interaction is to be time dependent (completed within a certain interval) by the test-taker. Check if this is the case.

Time dependence is useful for limiting the time in which a test-taker has to get through interactions within the examination. This will be covered in greater detail in Deliveries. 

**Step 5:** Click the blue *Done* button to finish editing.

When this is done, you can preview what your Text Entry item looks like. For more on how to preview, review its section.
