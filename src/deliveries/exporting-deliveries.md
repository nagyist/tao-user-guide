# Exporting deliveries

>Deliveries may be set up on almost any computer that has access to TAO. However, there will be situations in which arranging a Delivery on another system will be useful. The ability to transmit Deliveries becomes essential in just such a situation. Doing this takes only a few easy steps.

**Step 1:** Upon opening *Deliveries* from the Assessment Builder Bar, either click on an existing Delivery class (folder) in the Delivery Library panel, or click on the Deliveries folder itself. In the Actions Bar, click New Class. 

Creating a new class, or a new folder, allows the user to place Deliveries in an organized location in which they can be made ready to be transferred from one machine to another. When doing this, where it says “Edit class Assembled Delivery” in the canvas area, find the field marked *Label*. Here the Delivery class can be renamed, if desired.  Hitting the blue *Save* button will create the class.

**Step 2:** In the Delivery Library, move the Deliveries to be transferred to the class.

This selects the Deliveries that will be exported.

**Step 3:** After clicking on the class select from the Actions Bar *Export*.

Alternatively, an individual Delivery can be clicked on for exporting, without creating a new class to transfer it in. However, in most instances it is more useful to organize the transfer in a single folder that can be exported in one go.

The pane that comes up on the canvas will ask that you confirm that the folder highlighted is the one that should be exported. If the Delivery is to be exported as a Question and Test Interoperability (.qti) formatted document, it will save the files as a compressed .zip file. Otherwise, the export will be in Resource Description Framework (.rdf) format. Click the blue *Export* button in the pane to continue with the export.

**Step 4:** Select the location on which to export your Delivery, and then save.

The Delivery will then be available to transfer either by data storage device or over a computer network. The next step in the transfer is to import the Delivery onto the desired computer.
