# Style editor

>White, black, grey, and blue, all done up in a san-serif font. That can get boring after awhile. Let the *Style Editor* come to the rescue! The Item Style Editor is found in the same area of the TAO interface as the Properties Panel in an Item window. It should be noted that this feature is meant only to adjust the appearance of a small number of items. For larger numbers, refer to the CSS SDK.

**Step 1:**  To access the Style Editor, click on the Style Editor button in the Action Bar above the Properties Panel.

This will turn the Properties Panel into a Style Editor panel. There are two parts to the editor, the Style Sheet Manager at the top, and the Item Style Editor down below.

**Step 2:** If you have a style sheet ready for upload, click on the *Add Style Sheet* button. This will provide an interface similar to that of adding a graphic into a Graphic Interaction. In all other cases, if you will be editing styles in a way that is special for this Item only, focus on the Style Editor below.

Creating style sheets are to be handled in a whole other entry.

The Style Editor, meanwhile, has three segments, governing: (1) color, (2) Font, and (3) Item width. These can be adjusted in any order, but for the sake of this tutorial, we'll be going in order from top to bottom.

**Step 3:** Adjust colors as you'd like them.

There are four color swatches that can be changed in accordance with the needs of the user: Background color, Text color, Border color, and Table headings.

Clicking on the swatch opens a color editor panel that consists of a square surrounded by a ring, and a text box below. The ring provides the user with a color wheel that allows changes to the color. The square provides the ability to adjust contrast (left and right) and brightness (up and down). The textbox provides the ability to save a desired specific color setting when it is found as portions of Red, Green, Blue (in RGB hexidecimal-percent of primary color density).

The four swatches cover specific parts of any Item and its interactions. The Background color provides the color backing the entire item. The text color covers all text within the Item and its constituent interactions. The border color governs that of the borders of interactions. Finally, the table heading color swatch provides color to those interactions that use tables (such as Match).

**Step 4:** Adjust fonts as you'd like them.

There are two font controls governing the font family selection, and the font size. Adjusting the font family involves clicking on the appropriately marked box (which should start out reading *Default*). There are a number of fonts that are built into the system, and these are divided into "san serif" fonts (fonts without "feet" at the ends of letters), "serif" fonts (those with "feet"), and "monospace" fonts (fonts that resemble a typewriter, with each letter whether it be an "i" or an "m", having the same width as the other). The large number of fonts provides for significant flexibility in Item page design, but within the Item style editor, these are the only fonts that are available. To customize further from this list requires setting up a style sheet.

The other control allows Item authors to change the font size, pretty much to any size of font desired. To set a font size, click into the box and type in a number (13 point is the default). To adjust further from there, the Item author has the choice of either typing in a new number into the box, or clicking on the bigger or littler font icons. There is no limit to the size of font that can be selected, but of course when you get past 2800-point, the font will simply be too large to even partially display.

**Step 5:** Item width is set so that it adapts to the width of the user's screen. It is highly recommended that you use this setting only.

Because the QTI standard requires the ability to set an Item width on screens, the option to set a width is made available on TAO. However, setting a width that doesn't adapt to screen size will mean that different sized computer screens may have problems with the setting. There really isn't a need to adjust this under normal test authoring situations.

**Step 6:** If you don't like any of the settings you've selected, click on the eraser icon on the right of the control (the swatch or the text box), and the item will be restored to its default setting.

This can be particularly useful if in playing around with the item, the end result turns out to be something wholly unreadable. Default settings are always a click away.
