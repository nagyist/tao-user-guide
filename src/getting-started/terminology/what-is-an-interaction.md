# What is an interaction?

*"Interactions allow the candidate to interact with the item. Through an interaction, the candidate selects or constructs a response. The candidate's responses are stored in the response variables. Each interaction is associated with (at least) one response variable."* - Question and Test Interoperability standard, published by IMS Global

>Interactions serve as a basic unit of test-taker response. Items may be made up of one interaction or more than one related interactions. As such, the term *interaction* should not be considered interchangeable with *item*. 

Interactions are classified in four categories: simple, text-based, graphical, and miscellaneous. There are more than 17 interactions recognized by the QTI standard, which was set up with the intent to cover every method by which tests interact with test-takers.

In TAO, interactions include the mechanisms used to score themselves. Within simple items, this is relatively straight-forward, where correct answers add, in contrast to incorrect answers, to the test score. Scoring for a composite item using standard response templates (*match correct*, *map response*, or *map response point*) is often more complicated, but even at its most involved, the scoring is little more than a summation of its parts.
