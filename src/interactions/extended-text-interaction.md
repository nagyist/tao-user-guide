# Extended Text Interaction

>The Extended Text interaction provides the means of demonstrating the Text-taker's ability to recite exactly a phrase, sentence, or passage. The Test-taker is required to convey exactly an answer that can be of any length.

**Step 1:** From the Common Interactions menu in the Library Panel, drag the *Extended Text* icon onto the blank Item and drop into the blue block.

This opens a new Extended Text interaction window that shows a question field and an *extended text field*.

**Step 2:** Fill in the question field. 

Bear in mind that the answer should be one that the Test-taker will be expected to remember exactly, without any variation whatsoever. Even an extra space will result in the answer being marked incorrect.

**Step 3:** Click Response in the interaction header.

Here, the test-author will provide the expected answer. Again, the Test-taker will be expected to answer exactly. Any variation from what is entered here will result in the answer being marked as incorrect.
