# Gap Match Interaction

>The Gap Match item gives test-takers the opportunity to demonstrate knowledge in a manner similar to a normal Match interaction. The difference between the normal Match and a Gap Match, however, is that a set of match words are provided, to which some will fit into gaps within a selected text passage. In essence, this is a combination of a match Item and a "fill the gap" question. 

![Gap Match Step 1][media_bma021]

**Step 1:** From the Common Interactions menu in the Library, drag the *Gap Match* icon onto the blank Item and drop the resulting box in the blue text block.

This opens a new *Gap Match Interaction* window. There will be a field for placing in a question at the top, a space for the selection of match words in the middle, and a text field down below for placement of the gap-laden text.

**Step 2:** Fill in the question field. 

Typically this will be some variation on, "Fill in the gaps from the following word set."

**Step 3:** Cut and paste, or type in, the text within which gaps will be presented. 

It will be from this text that the gap match elements will be extracted.

**Step 4:** Select a word or phrase and highlight it.

This will create a *magic wand* button that, if pressed, confirms that you want to make this into a gap match element within the text.

![Gap Match Step 5][media_bma025]

**Step 5:** Click the *magic wand* button.

This creates a gap in the text, and places its match into the field of match words. It's possible to repeat Steps 4 and 5 as many times as needed to adequately assess the Test-taker*s knowledge of the passage.

**Step 6:** If desired, add extra options into the match words field by clicking the *add choice* button.

Additional words placed into the field may prevent the successful use of the "process of elimination" test-taker strategy. The test author may add as many extra words as desired. In the Properties Panel to the left, be sure to hit the *Shuffle choices* box if the order in which the match words are presented is not important. This prevents Test-takers from successfully cheating or making guesses based on that order.

![Gap Match Step 7][media_bma027]

**Step 7:** Once the field of match words is adequately populated, click *Response* to select answers. To do this, click an appropriate match selection and then the space in which it is supposed to be placed.

Fill all the gaps with their appropriate matches. If modal feedback is desirable for this interaction, you may enter it at this point. For more details on how to do this, see the *Modal Feedback* section.

**Step 8.** Click the blue *Done* button.

When this is done, you can preview what your Gap Match interaction looks like. For more on previewing, review its section.
