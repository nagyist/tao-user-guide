# Choice Interaction #

>Choice Interaction, most frequently referred to as the multiple choice question (MCQ), presents a test question type that has been made popular by such time-honored exams as the SAT, ACT, PSAT/NMSQT, etc. Choice interactions are preferable to free-response test items in cases where more test questions need to be fit into a shorter-duration exam period. Where time is of the essence is where this type of testing Item is particularly useful.

**Step 3:** This interaction has by default three choices in which to place alternative answers. Click *choice #1* text to edit the field it is in. Type the first answer option in this field. Repeat this step with the other choices to populate those fields.

Note that you can add more options by clicking the *Add Choice* blue field below the first three choices (keep clicking until the desired number of choices appear in the item), and you can delete options by clicking the trash can icon to the right of the choice you wish to delete.

**Step 4:** When all your choices have been defined, go to the Properties Panel and open Interaction Properties. Then define the number of choices that the user will be asked to provide.

By default, your MCQ is made of checkboxes, with a max of 0 (that means that your test-taker can select as many as choices he wants). 

To set up a radio button quiz item, select a maximum of 1. This means that your test-taker will be not allowed to select more than one choice.You can see on your item canvas that radio buttons will be displayed.

Tips -> If an answer is required, the Min choice should be at least "1" . If an answer is not required, select "0". 

Additionally, you'll notice above this in the Properties Panel is the option to *shuffle choices*.  Check this option will make your choices appear in a different order for each Test-taker. This allows the test publisher to negate the use of tried Test-taker strategies of guessing like "always select B if you don't know" or for cheating between earlier Test-takers and those taking the Test after them. Where the order isn't important, this is recommended. 

Tips -> Realize that to use this option, you won't want to prefix answers with A., B. … or 1., 2. … etc.

 **Step 7.** Click anywhere outside the Work Space. This will produce in the Properties Panel (to the right) a check box that can be set if the interaction is to be time dependent (completed within a certain interval) by the test-taker. Check if this is the case.

Time dependence is useful for limiting the time in which a test-taker has to get through interactions within the examination. This will be covered in greater detail in Deliveries. -->
