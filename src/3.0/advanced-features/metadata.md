# Metadata


>As an institution's collection of Items grows, most test authors will find that sorting through everything in order to find just the right set of interactions for a given Test will soon become unwieldy. TAO offers a way to keep track of the Items that are important for your Tests, even if there are hundreds or thousands of Items in your organization's data bank from which to choose. This is done through the use of Property Metadata. Metadata can be added to any Item, which can then be filtered through the search function situated above the Library in the blue Action Bar of your TAO interface.
>
>First, this entry will describe how to insert Property Metadata onto your Item both through the Properties window for a particular Class and through the List button, and then second, it will describe how to insert flags and filter through the Metadata by means of those flags using the Search function.
>
>It is worth noting that although this User Guide entry covers Metadata that apply to *Items*, nearly the same procedures apply also for Metadata applied to *Tests*, *Test-takers*, *Groups*, and *Deliveries*.

**Step 1:** Click on the class of Items in which the Property you intend to apply edits or additions. 

This brings up to view the Properties window of the class. This shows, below the folder Label, a list of Metadata that are associated with the class. The Label can easily be edited, but four of the Properties below it are not editable: *Item Content*, *Original Filename*, *Item Model*, and *Lock*. Other Properties that have been added by others can be edited, but not deleted. Properties that you add can both be edited and deleted.

**Step 2:**  To add a new Property in the class Metadata screen, click on the blue *Add Property* button below the Property list.

This adds a new Property at the end of the list. To add functionality to this piece of Metadata, you will need to edit the Property.

**Step 3:** To edit a Property in the class Metadata screen, click on the Edit icon located to the right of the Property. This is the button that appears like a pencil in a square.

When in *Simple Mode* (default), this brings up a small box in which Properties can be edited. The first field allows the Property Label (name) can be changed from *Property_X*.  The second field asks if the Property is language dependent; this is answerable by clicking on the appropriate radio button (the default is *false*). The third field asks that the Form Field Order be defined; this is the position in the list of Properties that the Property you are working with will appear. The fourth field asks the type of field being defined here. A drop-down menu provides five basic choices: **Text** (of which there are three options: *short-field*, *long-box*, and *long-HTML editor*), **List** (of which there are also three options: *Single choice - radio button*, *single choice - drop down menu*, and *multiple choice - check box*), **Calendar**, **Password**, and **File**.

When in *Advanced Mode* (changeable once the Edit icon has been clicked), the small box appears different. The first two fields are the same (*Label* and *Is Language Dependent*), but the Form Field Order and Type are replaced with Widget range, which provides a drop-down menu for selecting a Type (many more options are presented here), and a Resource Window, which allows for selection of resource types that apply to the Property.

Once you've selected the values that apply to this Class Property, hit the blue *Save* button to save changes. What this does is it opens a new Properties field on all the Items within the Class. These can be  Remember that you can delete the Properties you add by clicking the trash can icon situated to the right of the Edit icon.

**Step 4:** To edit an existing property using the List function, find and click the List button in the button bar below the Library.

This brings up an interface showing all the available properties applying to Items in your TAO Library. At the top of the interface, it also gives you the option to create a new list. In this interface, you will find all the lists that might apply to any of the Items created in your TAO set-up. All of these can be edited or deleted through this interface.

**Step 5:** To insert flags into Item Metadata, first select the Item in which you wish to apply your flag.

Flags are identifiers that you place into Property Metadata fields to help separate specific Items quickly and efficiently. These can be of any Metadata type already described.

**Step 6:** To set a flag, first select the Item in which you wish the flag to apply.

This will bring up the Properties window, which lists out the available Properties that may be used to filter through specific Metadata and find flagged Items.

**Step 7:** Click on the Property field that you will use to filter through your Items, and then enter the information you will use to flag this given Item for future use.

This can be used to identify items used in a specific course, for a specific instructor, within a given Test, etc. Once the data is entered, you will be able to filter this Item using the Search function.

**Step 8:** To Search for your flagged Items, first click on the Search button in the blue Action Bar.

This brings up a gray search window at the top of the Item library, which gives you various options in which to find the Items you want. These include the ability to filter through the Label field (if you've named your Items a specific way so as to facilitate finding them easier), Language field, Item Model type, or any of the specific Metadata that you entered for Items in the Class in which you are working from.

Note, if you are only searching through the Label field, you can select Filter to sort through the names of your Items.

**Step 9:** Once you've selected the filter criteria for your search, hit the blue Search button.

This will bring up in your canvas a list of Items that meet your filter criteria. In this window, you can select any one of the items with which to open. This could be to preview, or to author, or simply to identify where the Item is located for use in building your Test.
