# Metadata


>As an institution's collection of Items grows, most test authors will find that finding the right interaction set for a given Test will soon become an unwieldy task. TAO offers a way to easily sort out the Items that are important for your Tests, even if there are hundreds or thousands of Items in your organization's data bank from which to choose. This is done through Metadata. Metadata provides certain descriptive flags that can be filtered through the search box, located above the Library in the blue Action Bar, and can be added to any Item.
>
>First, this entry will describe how to insert Metadata onto your Item both through the Properties window for a particular Class and through the List button, and then second, it will describe how to use flags for filtering.
>
>It is worth noting that although this User Guide entry covers Metadata that apply to *Items*, nearly the same procedures apply also for Metadata applied to *Tests*, *Test-takers*, *Groups*, and *Deliveries*.

**Step 1:** Click on an Item class to add or edit properties. 

This brings up to view the class' Properties window. This shows, below the folder Label, a Metadata list that is associated with the class. The Label can easily be edited, but four Properties listed below it are not editable: *Item Content*, *Original Filename*, *Item Model*, and *Lock*. Properties that have been added by others can be edited, but not deleted. Properties that you add can both be edited and deleted.

**Step 2:**  To add a new Property in the class Properties window, click on the blue *Add Property* button below the Property list.

This adds a new Property at the end of the list. To add functionality, you will need to edit the Property.

**Step 3:** To edit a Property in the Properties window for the class, click on the Edit icon located to the right. This is the button that appears like a pencil in a square.

When in *Simple Mode* (default), the Edit icon brings up a small box in which the Item's Properties can be edited. The first field allows the Property Label (name) to be changed from *Property_X*. The second field asks if the Property is language dependent; to answer, click on the appropriate radio button (the default is *false*). The third field asks that the Form Field Order be defined; this is the position in the list that the Property you are working with will appear. The fourth field asks the field type being defined here. A drop-down menu provides five basic choices: **Text** (three options: *short-field*, *long-box*, and *long-HTML editor*), **List** (three options: *Single choice - radio button*, *single choice - drop down menu*, and *multiple choice - check box*), **Calendar**, **Password**, and **File**.

When in *Advanced Mode* (which can be selected once the Edit icon has been clicked), the small box appears different. The first two fields are the same (*Label* and *Is Language Dependent*), but the Form Field Order and Type are replaced with Widget range, which provides a drop-down menu for selecting a Property Type (many more options are presented here), and a Resource Window, through which a Property resource type can be selected.

Once you've selected the values that apply to this Property, hit the blue *Save* button to save changes. What this does is it opens a new Properties field on all the Items within the Class. Remember that you can delete the Properties you add by clicking the trash can icon.

**Step 4:** To edit an existing property using the List function, find and click the List button in the button bar below the Library.

This brings up a window showing all the available properties that apply to Items in your TAO Library. At the top of the window, the user can click on a button to create a new list. In this view, you will find all the lists that might apply to any Item set created in your TAO set-up. These can be edited or deleted here.

**Step 5:** To insert flags into any Item Metadata, first select the Item in which you wish to apply your flag.

Flags are identifiers that you place into Metadata fields to help separate specific Items quickly and efficiently. These can be inserted into any Property type already described.

**Step 6:** To set a flag, first select the Item in which you wish the flag to apply.

This will bring up the Properties window, which lists out the available Properties that may be used to filter through specific Metadata and find flagged Items.

**Step 7:** Click on the Property field that you will use to filter through your Items, and then enter the information you will use to flag this given Item for future use.

This can be used to identify Items used in a specific course, for a specific instructor, within a given Test, etc. Once the data is entered, you will be able to filter this Item using the Search function.

**Step 8:** To Search for your flagged Items, first click on the Search button in the blue Action Bar.

This brings up a gray search window above the Item library, which gives you various options in which to find the Items you want. These include the ability to filter through the Label field (if you've named your Items a specific way so as to facilitate finding them easier), Language field, Item Model type, or any Metadata that you entered for Items in the Class in which you are working from.

Note, if you are only searching through the Label field, you can select Filter to sort through the names of your Items.

**Step 9:** Once you've selected the filter criteria for your search, hit the blue Search button.

This will bring up in your canvas a list of Items that meet your filter criteria. In this window, you can select any Item you wish to open. This could be to preview, or to author, or simply to identify where the Item is located for use in building your Test.
