# What is TAO

>TAO is the future of online assessment development.

TAO prides itself on being one of the most advanced test authoring tools on the market using the Question and Test Interoperability (QTI) standard for E-test development. TAO represents one of the first great steps beyond the domination of expensive and inflexible proprietary testing software.

Almost as easy as taking pen to paper, and with results that are a whole lot more impressive, TAO allows educators and other test-writers the ability to create E-tests on the fly, and smoothly administer them to whole classes of students in minutes. Moments after the last test is submitted, grades can be ready for review.

TAO is the first commercial-grade Open Source assessment development software on the market. It is QTI and LTI standards-based, and operates under audit-proof transparency. Developers can access the source code for their own test-creating or administering purposes, opening the user to a wide range of potential customizations. Without the restrictions and high costs of proprietary testing, all assessments can easily display the educational institutions signature designs. Further, TAO is fully compatible with just about all of your favorite commercial add-ons.

TAO is certified as QTI compliant in four categories

- Authoring and editing systems
- Delivery systems
- Item and test bank systems
- QTI content

What this means is that test content is entirely portable, secure, and ready for any curricula that embraces technology-centric education models.
