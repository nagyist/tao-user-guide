# What is an item?

*"An item is a set of interactions (possibly empty) collected together with any supporting material and an optional set of rules for converting the candidate's response(s) into assessment outcomes."* - Question and Test Interoperability standard, published by IMS Global

![Term Item][media_bma183]

>Items are the basic building blocks for [assessments][i_0006]. They may contain one stand-alone interaction (called a *simple item*), or they may contain several closely-related interactions, all the same type or of a mixture of types (called a *composite item*). Of utmost importance here, the term *item* should not be considered interchangeable [with *interaction*.][i_0005] 

Beyond the interactions contained within them, Items include titles, images, and text that help the Test-taker understand the expectations and context of the assessment material presented within. Their complexity ranges from simple items with a singular interaction to composite items with multiple interactions.
